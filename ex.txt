I am an unemployed graduate of mechanical engineering from Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike Nigeria.
Due to the corrupt and inept leadership Nigeria a country with vast oil wealth has not been able to fulfill her potentials.
Nigeria is hugely dependent on crude oil exports without any processing and refining capability.
this coupled with the current crash in oil prices has lead to our present economic woes.
There is a dearth of industries and a general lack of meaningful employment for university graduates.
Meanwhile our numerous and severely underfunded universities keep churning out graduates year after.
